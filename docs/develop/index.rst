Introduction
============

We welcome all new developers and contributors with very friendly community.
Join #FlexGet @ freenode.

Technologies used
-----------------

List of external libraries and utilities. As for new libraries, we require that all of them are
installable on Windows trough ``pip``. This will exclude things that require compilers like LXML.

Core
~~~~

* SQLAlchemy
* BeautifulSoup
* Feedparser
* Python-Requests
* PyNBZ
* Jinja2
* PyYaml
* jsonschema
* Some smaller misc libraries

WebUI
~~~~~

* Flask
* Jinja2
* CherryPy

CherryPy is only used for WSGI server.

How do I get started?
---------------------

Set up development environment, which is basically just two steps.

#. `GIT clone`_ our repository.
#. - Either the wheel package of `setuptools`_ and `pip`_ need to be in the directory with bootstrap.py
   - Or `virtualenv`_ package needs to be installed.
#. Run ``bootstrap.py`` with Python 2.6.x - 2.7.x.

For easier collaboration we recommend forking us on github and sending pull
request. Once we see any semi-serious input from a developer we will grant
write permissions to our central repository. You can also request this earlier
if you wish.

If you are new to Git there are several interactive tutorials you can try to get
you started including `tryGit`_ and `LearnGitBranching`_.

Environment
-----------

Once you have bootstrapped the environment you have fully functional FlexGet in
a `virtual environment`_ in your clone directory. You can easily add or modify
existing plugins in here and it will not mess your other FlexGet instances in
any way. The commands in the documentation expect the virtual environment to be
activated. If you don't activate it you must run commands explicitly from under
environment ``bin`` directory or ``scripts`` in windows. E.g. ``flexget`` would
be ``bin/flexget`` (at project root) in unactivated `virtual environment`_.

How to activate virtualenv under linux::

  source bin/activate

FlexGet project uses `paver`_ to provide development related utilities and tasks.
Run ``paver --help`` to see what commands are available. Some of these will
be mentioned later.

Code quality
------------

Unit tests
~~~~~~~~~~

There are currently over 250 unit tests ensuring that existing functionality
is not accidentally broken. Unit tests can be invoked with the installation
of additionnal requirments:

  pip install jenkins-requirements.txt

Easiest way to run tests is trough paver::

  paver test

By default no online tests are executed, these can be enabled with ``--online``
argument. There are other ways to run the tests as well, more specifically
we use `nose`_ framework.

Run single test file via nose::

  nosetests test_file

Run single test suite (class)::

  nosetests test_file:class

Run single test case from suite::

  nosetests test_file:class.case

Live example::

  nosetests test_seriesparser:TestSeriesParser.test_basic

.. NOTE::

   Don't use .py extension or include path with these. Configuration file ``setup.cfg`` defines
   needed parameters for Nose.

Project has `Jenkins CI server`_ which polls master branch and makes runs tests
and makes new build if they pass.

Unit tests are not mandatory for a plugin to be included in the FlexGet
distribution but it makes maintaining our code trough project life and
refactoring so much easier.

Code Style
~~~~~~~~~~

All code should be formatted according to `Python PEP8`_ recommendations. With
the exception of line length limit at 79 characters. FlexGet uses 120 characters
instead.

To run PEP8 checker::

  paver pep8

We do have some violations in our codebase, but new code should not add any.
