How to use GIT checkout
-----------------------

Check that you have Python 2.6 - 2.7 available with command ``python -V``.

In some environments newer (or older, if your distro is on python 3,) python
might be available under another name like 'python26' or 'python2.7' in which
case you need to use that one instead of plain 'python'.

To start using FlexGet from this directory, run the following commands::

    python bootstrap.py

This will initialize python virtualenv and install all required dependencies
in it.

If you need deluge or transmission libraries from system wide python use::

    python bootstrap.py --system-site-packages

After that FlexGet is usable via ``<checkout directory>/bin/flexget``. Verify
installation by running::

    bin/flexget -V

You may also place the configuration files in ``~/.flexget`` (Unix, Mac OS X)
or ``C:\Documents and Setting\<username>\flexget`` (Windows).

If you don't want to use virtualenv there's ``flexget_vanilla.py`` file which
can be used to run FlexGet without bootstrapping, note that you will need to
install all required dependencies yourself.
