        Between the Covers","overview":"Love Between the Covers is a feature-length
        documentary film about the little-known, surprisingly powerful community of
        women who read and write romance novels. Romance fiction is a female-powered
        engine of commerce, a multibillion-dollar business, and a tech-savvy global
        sisterhood. Women who write and think about relationships turn out to be amazing
        community builders. Love Between the Covers takes us inside this world, one
        of the few places where women are always center stage, where female characters
        always win, where justice prevails in every book, and where the broad spectrum
        of desires of women from all backgrounds are not feared but explored unapologetically.
        For three years, we follow the lives of five published romance novel authors
        and one unpublished newbie as they build their businesses, find and lose loved
        ones, cope with a tsunami of change in publishing, and earn a living doing
        what they love-while empowering others to do the same. We watch romance authors
        and readers","year":2015,"images":{"poster":{"full":null,"medium":null,"thumb":null},"fanart":{"full":null,"medium":null,"thumb":null}},"ids":{"trakt":217608,"slug":"love-between-the-covers","imdb":"tt4424350","tmdb":336992}}}]'}
