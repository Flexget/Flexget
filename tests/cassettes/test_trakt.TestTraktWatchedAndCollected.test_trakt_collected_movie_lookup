          documentary film about the little-known, surprisingly powerful community
          of women who read and write romance novels. Romance fiction is a female-powered
          engine of commerce, a multibillion-dollar business, and a tech-savvy global
          sisterhood. Women who write and think about relationships turn out to be
          amazing community builders. Love Between the Covers takes us inside this
          world, one of the few places where women are always center stage, where
          female characters always win, where justice prevails in every book, and
          where the broad spectrum of desires of women from all backgrounds are not
          feared but explored unapologetically. For three years, we follow the lives
          of five published romance novel authors and one unpublished newbie as they
          build their businesses, find and lose loved ones, cope with a tsunami of
          change in publishing, and earn a living doing what they love-while empowering
          others to do the same. We watch romance authors and readers","year":2015,"images":{"poster":{"full":null,"medium":null,"thumb":null},"fanart":{"full":null,"medium":null,"thumb":null}},"ids":{"trakt":217608,"slug":"love-between-the-covers","imdb":"tt4424350","tmdb":336992}}}]'}
