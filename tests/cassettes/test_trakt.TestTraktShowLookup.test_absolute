          Garu and Pucca help their town of Sooga Village out when evil ninjas attack,
          as well as diffuse a lot of the absurd situations that frequently plague
          the town.  This show could best be described as a cleaned-up version of
          South Park meets Looney Tunes meets Naruto.  There is some very subtly hidden
          adult humor; but most of the adult jokes would not go noticed by small children,
