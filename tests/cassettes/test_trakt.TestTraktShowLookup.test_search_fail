          The Flumps was a popular children's programme broadcast on British television\
          \ in 1976 and produced by David Yates and narrated by Gay Soper. The plot\
          \ revolved around the various adventures of a family of furry, human-like\
          \ characters called The Flumps.The family was headed by Father Flump who\
          \ was very clever and often invented things. Mother Flump spent most of\
          \ her time tidying and did the cooking and often read to the young Flumps,\
          \ stories from the big book. Perkin Flump was the eldest of the children\
          \ and often wore a yellow and blue hat. Posie was the only girl and she\
          \ always wore a bright blue ribbon on her head. Pootle was the youngest\
          \ member of the Flump family, he often got things confused and he sometimes\
          \ wore a white hat. Grandfather Flump was the oldest Flump and spent most\
          \ of his time either in the garden playing with the younger Flumps or playing\
          \ his Flumpet (musical instrument). If Grandfather was not doing any of\
          \ the above then he would sometimes be found sitting in the comfy chair\
          \ reading his paper or sleeping under it as was often the case. He always\
          \ woke up for tea though, especially if Mother Flump had been baking. Each\

          \ 1975 BBC television adaptation of L.M. Montgomery's beloved novel follows\
          \ a maturing Anne Shirley (Kim Braden) on her journey from freckle-faced\
          \ girl to beautiful woman. While working as a schoolteacher, Anne continues\
          \ to pursue her dream of becoming a published writer by winning a baking\
          \ soda company's essay contest; fends off several suitors; and returns to\
          \ Avonlea whenever she can to visit her adoptive mother, Marilla (Barbara\
          \ Hamilton).The first four episodes adapt the \\\"Anne of Avonlea\\\" novel\
          \ itself, which follows Anne from age 16 to 18 during the two years that\
          \ she teaches at the Avonlea School, where she has problems with Anthony\
          \ Pye. Fortunately she has at least one sharp student with young Paul Irving\
          \ (Keith Steven) from the United States. Beyond that Anne is involved with\
          \ Diana, Gilbert, Charlie Sloan (Peter Settelen), Fred Wright (Martin Neil),\
          \ and their other former schoolmates with the newly formed Avonlea Village\
          \ Improvement Society. Meanwhile, Marilla has adopted the twins Davy (Nicholas\
          \ Lyndhurst) and Dora Keith (Annabelle Lanyon) when their mother dies. Then\
          \ there is the trouble with Daisy and Anne's neighbor Mr. Harrison (David\
          \ Garfield) and the eccentric Miss Lavender Lewis (Kathleen Byron) and her\
          \ maid Charlotte IV (Claire Lewis). Needless to say, Rachel Lynde (Madge\
          \ Ryan) is hovering around giving her advice at each and every opportunity.\
          \ The final two episodes condense \\\"Anne of the Island\\\" and find Anne\
          \ attending Redmond College when Rachel moves in with Marilla after Thomas\
          \ Lynde dies. Anne and her roommates Philippa Gordon (Sabina Franklyn) and\
          \ Priscilla (Sandy Dickinson), move out of a strict boarding house and into\
          \ Patty's Place. Anne turns down a pair of proposals, one from Gilbert and\
          \ the next from a somewhat surprising source, before she starts seeing Roy\
          \ Gardiner (Anthony Forrest), who seems to be everything Anne has dreamt\
          \ of in a beau. But then his mother (Betty McDowall) visits Green Gables\
          \ and tries to find out about Anne's parents, which is where the adaptation\
          \ written by Elaine Morgan wrongly starts tinkering with the resolution\
          \ of the story, where \\\"Love Takes Up the Glass of Time.\\\" When Anne\
          \ goes to visit the place where she is born, she asks Gilbert to accompany\
          \ her, and later when she opens her mouth to say her fateful \\\"yes\\\"\
          \ to the marriage proposal she has been dreaming of, it is the flowers sent\
          \ her by Gilbert that take her out of the moment. Then when she arrives\
          \ back at Green Gables and learns that Gilbert is dying, Marilla talks her\
          \ into going over in the middle of the night to see Gilbert and the happy\
          \ ending comes about pretty quickly. This is something of a disappointment\
          \ because I always loved the way Montgomery had Anne respond to Gilbert's\
          \ final proposal: \\\"Still Anne could not speak. But she lifted her eyes,\
          \ shining with all the love-rapture of countless generations, and looked\
          \ into his for a moment. He wanted no other answer.\\\" That is pretty romantic,\
          \ and the final line that Morgan comes up with for Anne totally pales compared\
          \ to when Anne tells Gilbert, \\\"I don't want sunbursts and marble halls.\
          \ I just want YOU.\\\" Both the old black & white movie with Anne Shirley\
          \ (nee Dawn O'Day) and the Kevin Sullivan mini-series version of \\\"Anne\
          \ of Avonlea\\\" with Megan Follows focused more on what ended up being\
          \ the fourth novel in the series, \\\"Anne of Windy Poplars,\\\" where she\
          \ goes off to teach at a private school for young ladies. So the relative\
          \ fidelity to the two books is certainly appreciated. I especially liked\
          \ the inclusion of what happened with Ruby Gillis (Kim Hardy), but the irony\
          \ of the love between Phil Gordon and Jonas Blake (David Troughton) is sketched\
          \ out rather than developed. This is not to say that Morgan does not come\
          \ up with some decent new moments; she uses the character of Mrs. Blythe\
          \ (Hazel Bainbridge) to nice advantage. As for the performances, I am in\
          \ the Megan Follows IS Anne camp, and Braden keeps striking me as focusing\
          \ on Anne's flightiness at the expense of her intelligence and kindness.\
          \ Hamilton and Ryan as Marilla and Rachel take turns stealing scenes from\
          \ the young folks, but there is pretty much a generational gap on acting\
          \ talent here. Anne's fans will want to check this out, but relatively few\
          \ will find this production to be their favorite L.M. Montgomery adaptation.\"\
