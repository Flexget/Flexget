        Beyond Words: The JK Rowling Story","overview":"Magic Beyond Words: The J.K.
        Rowling Story is a made-for-TV film starring Australian actress Poppy Montgomery.
        The film, which was shot in B.C. Canada locations altered to look like British
        locations, details the journey of struggling single mother J. K. Rowling,
        her bid to become a published author, and her rise to fame that followed the
        publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher''s Stone. The film aired on
        Lifetime on July 18th and was criticized for being too lacklustre (mainly
        down to the fiercely private author having no say in the production) but it
        also shed some light on her personal life and featured scenes such as her
        highly abusive first husband and the death of her mother. The eponymous J.K.
        Rowling is the world''s first billionaire (in terms of US dollars) author
        and the films inspired by her books have been the highest grossing films of
        all time.  Poppy Montgomery reportedly got blue contact lenses to play the
        role of the highly influential author.","year":2011,"images":{"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/movies/000/059/971/posters/original/d5c52dbee5.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/movies/000/059/971/posters/medium/d5c52dbee5.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/movies/000/059/971/posters/thumb/d5c52dbee5.jpg"},"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/movies/000/059/971/fanarts/original/7505ef5301.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/movies/000/059/971/fanarts/medium/7505ef5301.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/movies/000/059/971/fanarts/thumb/7505ef5301.jpg"}},"ids":{"trakt":59971,"slug":"magic-beyond-words-the-jk-rowling-story-2011","imdb":"tt1979269","tmdb":80530}}}]'}
