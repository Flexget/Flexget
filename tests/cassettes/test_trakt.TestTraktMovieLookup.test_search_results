          Beyond Words: The JK Rowling Story","overview":"Magic Beyond Words: The
          J.K. Rowling Story is a made-for-TV film starring Australian actress Poppy
          Montgomery. The film, which was shot in B.C. Canada locations altered to
          look like British locations, details the journey of struggling single mother
          J. K. Rowling, her bid to become a published author, and her rise to fame
          that followed the publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher''s Stone.
          The film aired on Lifetime on July 18th and was criticized for being too
          lacklustre (mainly down to the fiercely private author having no say in
          the production) but it also shed some light on her personal life and featured
          scenes such as her highly abusive first husband and the death of her mother.
          The eponymous J.K. Rowling is the world''s first billionaire (in terms of
          US dollars) author and the films inspired by her books have been the highest
          grossing films of all time.  Poppy Montgomery reportedly got blue contact
          lenses to play the role of the highly influential author.","year":2011,"images":{"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/movies/000/059/971/posters/original/d5c52dbee5.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/movies/000/059/971/posters/medium/d5c52dbee5.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/movies/000/059/971/posters/thumb/d5c52dbee5.jpg"},"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/movies/000/059/971/fanarts/original/7505ef5301.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/movies/000/059/971/fanarts/medium/7505ef5301.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/movies/000/059/971/fanarts/thumb/7505ef5301.jpg"}},"ids":{"trakt":59971,"slug":"magic-beyond-words-the-jk-rowling-story-2011","imdb":"tt1979269","tmdb":80530}}}]'}
