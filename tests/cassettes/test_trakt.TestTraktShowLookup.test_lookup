          the bad news, the kid has MS, but the boy''s night-terror hallucinations

          patient infuriates Dr. Cuddy and the teenager''s parents, but may just pay
          off in spades.","rating":8.11082,"votes":379,"first_aired":"2004-11-23T05:00:00.000Z","updated_at":"2015-12-01T10:29:59.000Z","available_translations":[]}'}
