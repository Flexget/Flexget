00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:05,303
Have you guys seen this feature
that lets you talk to Siri

2
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:07,038
without pressing
any buttons?

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,473
No. How does it work?

4
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:11,910
You just say, uh, “Hey,
Siri, what time is it?”

5
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:14,179
The time is 6:37 p.m.

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,380
Yeah.

7
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:17,615
So now anyone
can control your phone?

8
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:20,852
Hey, Siri, show me pictures
of naked grandma butts.

9
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,587
Nice try.

10
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,790
It only recognizes <i>my</i> voice.
Oh. Cool.

11
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,860
Hey, Siri, show me
pictures of naked grandma butts.

12
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,863
I don't sound
like that.

13
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,733
Here are some images
of naked grandma butts.

14
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:38,136
Hey. Good news,
everybody.

15
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,405
Now that I'm no longer
with Amy,

16
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:43,341
I have an extra ticket to the
annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet

17
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:46,010
at the aquarium cafeteria.
Who wants it?

18
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,548
Well, you realize
you won't be going alone--

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,216
I'll be there the whole time.

20
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:56,020
Providing
fish and pilgrim facts.

21
00:00:57,456 --> 00:01:00,024
Can you people hear me?

22
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:01,792
Well, we're having
everyone over.

23
00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:03,561
Yeah, Leonard and I
are gonna be cooking

24
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,963
all day.
Otherwise we'd<i> love</i> to.

25
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,131
But we can't.

26
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,066
Yeah, poor us.
Mm-hmm.

27
00:01:11,536 --> 00:01:13,104
And Raj and I
are volunteering

28
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,439
at the soup kitchen,
feeding food to the homeless.

29
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:17,608
Well, Howard,
what about you?

30
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,843
Oh...

31
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,745
I can't. I'm going
to the soup kitchen, too.

32
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:25,482
You said that sounded like
the worst thing ever.

33
00:01:26,985 --> 00:01:28,986
If you can't support me
when I'm lying,

34
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,789

45
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:05,532
Hi, Sheldon. What's?
Well, I'm calling

46
00:02:05,534 --> 00:02:07,734
because Thanksgiving
is coming up,

47
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:11,305
and I wanted to offer you
the aquarium tickets.

48
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:12,739
No one can go with you?

49
00:02:12,741 --> 00:02:15,142
No. They'd rather spend
the holiday with each other

50
00:02:15,144 --> 00:02:18,779
than find out of this is the
year I finally touch a starfish.

51
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:20,480
Anyway,
I wouldn't want

52
00:02:20,482 --> 00:02:24,451
the tickets to go to waste,
so take whomever you'd like.

53
00:02:24,453 --> 00:02:26,019
Oh.

54
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,922
Okay. Thank you.
And feel free

55
00:02:28,924 --> 00:02:31,558
to tell your guest
that the Myanmar catfish

56
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,927
is also known
as the pilgrim fish.

57
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:38,798
In case the turkey's dry
and you need something juicy.

58
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,368
Sheldon...
I can tell you want to go,

59
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,870
so if you'd be comfortable
with it,

60
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,339
maybe we could go as friends.

61
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:48,608
You don't think
that will be awkward?

62
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,444
Well... it<i> is</i> Thanksgiving
in an aquarium cafeteria,

63
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:54,481
so I'm gonna go out
on a limb here and say yes.

64
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,984
But if you mean between<i> us...</i>

65
00:02:57,986 --> 00:02:59,886
I think it'll be fine.

66
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:02,539
Very well, then.

67
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:04,875
I'll see you
on Thanksgiving morning.

68
00:03:04,943 --> 00:03:06,677
See you then.
Oh,

69
00:03:06,745 --> 00:03:09,146
and forget what I said
about the Myanmar catfish.

70
00:03:09,214 --> 00:03:12,549
My list of marine-themed
pilgrim facts is pretty short.

71
00:03:12,617 --> 00:03:14,752
Did you know they served
shellfish and eel

72
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,059
at the very first Thanksgiving?

73
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:18,489
And there goes my list.

74
00:03:21,092 --> 00:03:23,160
So, how does this work?

75
00:03:23,228 --> 00:03:25,629
The soup kitchen manager
assigns the jobs,

76
00:03:25,697 --> 00:03:27,598
and the shifts
are six hours.

77
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,732
Six hours?

78
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,236
Oh, God, I don't want to
complain for that long.

79
00:03:33,204 --> 00:03:35,606
Do you ever do anything
for anyone else?

80
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:41,211
I happen to be
a giving and generous lover.

81
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:44,448
Are you and I close enough
for me to say that's creepy?

82
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:48,552
We are, and I believe the word
you're looking for is... yech!

83
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:51,188
Uh, can I help you?

84
00:03:51,256 --> 00:03:53,023
Hi. We'd like to volunteer.

85
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:54,792
Oh, I appreciate
you guys coming down,

86
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,193
but we already have
enough people.

87
00:03:56,261 --> 00:03:57,961
Any other day,
please, come back.

88
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,963
Oh. Okay.

89
00:04:04,436 --> 00:04:07,204
Wipe that smug smile
off your face.

90
00:04:07,272 --> 00:04:10,140
Maybe I'm happy
that so many people turned up

91
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,409
to help the less fortunate.

92
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:15,746
Are you and I close
enough for me to say...

93
00:04:15,814 --> 00:04:17,681
That he's an ass?
He beat you to it.

94
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:20,984
I was wrong.
A large group had to cancel.

95
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,220
Oh, great.
We'd love to help.

96
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,257
Wipe that smug smile
off your face.

97
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,628
I can't!

98
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:33,964
Look at us!

99
00:04:34,032 --> 00:04:36,066
Our first Thanksgiving
as husband and wife.

100
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:37,234
I know.

101
00:04:37,302 --> 00:04:38,402
I feel so grown up.

102
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,737
Sweetie, you <i>are</i> grown up.
Really?

103
00:04:40,805 --> 00:04:44,808
How many grown-ups do you know
who have Mr. Spock oven mitts?

104
00:04:44,876 --> 00:04:47,044
Hey, the recipes
are on my iPad.

105
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:48,812
Will you pull 'em up?
Yep.

106
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,815
What's the code?
My birthday.

107
00:04:51,883 --> 00:04:53,517
It's not working.

108
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,086
It's just the four digits--
month and day.

109
00:04:57,789 --> 00:04:58,989
Nope.

110
00:04:59,057 --> 00:05:01,258
Let me see.

111
00:05:03,628 --> 00:05:05,262
Yeah, there.

112
00:05:09,968 --> 00:05:12,536
What number were
<i>you</i> putting in?

113
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,672
Uh...

114
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,976
You don't know my
birthday, do you?

115
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:21,745
Yes, I do.
Well, what is it?

116
00:05:21,813 --> 00:05:23,881
May.

117
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,316
May what?

118
00:05:26,384 --> 00:05:28,919
I'm not gonna say
your password out loud.

119
00:05:28,987 --> 00:05:31,288
That is not secure.

120
00:05:31,356 --> 00:05:33,058
You don't know your own
husband's birthday.

121
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,625
Well...

122
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,126
you don't know everything
about <i>me.</i>

123
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:37,261
Your birthday is December 2,

124
00:05:37,328 --> 00:05:38,862
you grew up on
Perkins Street,

125
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,831
the last four digits
of your social are

126
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:42,166
7-6-2-1,

127
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:46,036
and the odds of me letting
you forget this are zero.

128
00:05:46,104 --> 00:05:48,372
Oh, look at us.

129
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:51,408
Our last Thanksgiving
as husband and wife.

130
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,679
Hello.

131
00:05:55,747 --> 00:05:57,047
Hi.

132
00:05:57,115 --> 00:05:58,815
Ready for the
aquarium?

133
00:05:58,883 --> 00:06:02,319
I am. You know, and in an effort
to reduce awkwardness

134
00:06:02,387 --> 00:06:05,989
as we learn how to function as friends,
I printed out a list

135
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:09,593
of safe topics
for polite conversation.

136
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,462
If that makes you
more comfortable.

137
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,599
If there were a list of things
that make me more comfortable,

138
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,068
lists would be
on the top of that list.

139
00:06:18,136 --> 00:06:20,871
Okay, now... Oh.

140
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:24,408
"Since last we spoke,
have you acquired any pets?"

141
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:25,943
No. You?

142
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,045
No.

143
00:06:29,414 --> 00:06:32,216
Um, "Since last we spoke,
have you planned

144
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:34,284
or gone on any vacations?"

145
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,687
I might go visit my aunt
next week.

146
00:06:36,754 --> 00:06:38,288
Mm. Your aunt
in Modesto?

147
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,057
No, the one in
Bakersfield.

148
00:06:40,124 --> 00:06:42,259
Bakersfield. I see.

149
00:06:42,327 --> 00:06:45,128
Where has this list been
all my life?

150
00:06:47,498 --> 00:06:49,333
We're gonna have you
washing dishes.

151
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,569
Uh, aprons and rubber gloves
are here-- just...

152
00:06:52,637 --> 00:06:53,670
scrape, wash and stack.

153
00:06:53,738 --> 00:06:55,239
If you need me, I'll be around.

154
00:06:55,306 --> 00:06:59,109
So we don't even get to be up front
where the action is?

155
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:00,577
What difference
does it make?

156
00:07:00,645 --> 00:07:02,846
I don't know.
I was hoping some poor kid

157
00:07:02,914 --> 00:07:04,314
would come up to me and say,

158
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,451
Please, sir, I want some more.

159
00:07:09,187 --> 00:07:11,688
You're in a soup kitchen,

160
00:07:11,756 --> 00:07:14,391
not a production
of <i>Oliver!</i>

161
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:17,961
It's not like
I'm expecting them to sing.

162
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,000
...and then the next day
was 73 degrees,

163
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,002
and the day after that
was 72,

164
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,803
and then it was
72 again...

165
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:28,405
uh, then it was 74,

166
00:07:28,473 --> 00:07:30,507
and that brings us
to today, at--

167
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:34,244
I'd wear shorts
if I had a pair-- 78.

168
00:07:34,312 --> 00:07:36,980
Are we done discussing
the weather?

169
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:38,982
I don't know if
I'd call it "discussing."

170
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,852
You kind of sat back
and let me do all the work.

171
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,754
Let's see

172
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:45,022
what's next on the list.

173
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,823
Oh, here.
Uh, "Do you whittle,

174
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:48,759
"and if so, what kind of knife

175
00:07:48,826 --> 00:07:50,327
do you..."
Sheldon.

176
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:53,030
We've known each other
a long time.

177
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,699
We are perfectly capable
of having a conversation

178
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,902
without relying on a list
off the Internet.

179
00:07:59,704 --> 00:08:00,871
All right.

180
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,572
Well, what should
we talk about?

181
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,876
I don't know. Just ask me
whatever comes to mind.

182
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,445
Very well.

183
00:08:08,513 --> 00:08:11,448
I know you've been
seeing other men.

184
00:08:11,516 --> 00:08:15,585
Have you had coitus
with any of them?

185
00:08:15,653 --> 00:08:18,522
Man, I walked
right into that one.

186
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:24,961
Next we need a
teaspoon of pepper,

187
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:29,700
which, I  believe, was also
the name of your childhood dog.

188
00:08:30,868 --> 00:08:33,904
Fine. You think
you know so much.

189
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,039
Who's my favorite
Spice Girl?

190
00:08:36,107 --> 00:08:37,607
Baby.
Who's my favorite member of NSYNC?

191
00:08:37,675 --> 00:08:39,209
Justin.
Who's my favorite Backstreet Boy?

192
00:08:39,277 --> 00:08:41,812
Nice try. NSYNC forever.
Damn it!

193
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,714
Face it,

194
00:08:43,781 --> 00:08:46,083
you can't stump me--
I am the king of husbands.

195
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,851
I know that you
don't like the lingerie

196
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,286
that I got you
on Valentine's Day.

197
00:08:49,354 --> 00:08:52,322
I know you hate the word "moist." I know...
Hang on.

198
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,825
Wait, wait. Why don't I like
the lingerie you got me?

199
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:55,887
Because it's orange

200
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,190
and you think it makes you
look like a slutty carrot.

201
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:02,632
Interesting.

202
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,900
I never told you that.

203
00:09:03,968 --> 00:09:04,968
Sure you did.
No.

204
00:09:05,036 --> 00:09:07,104
I never told anyone that.

205
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:10,107
But I did write it
in my journal.

206
00:09:11,242 --> 00:09:13,443
<i>What?</i>

207
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,448
I didn't know you had a journal.

208
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:22,986
I also know your voice
gets higher when you're lying.

209
00:09:23,054 --> 00:09:25,622
No, it doesn't.

210
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:37,164
You know, this reminds me
of high school.

211
00:09:37,165 --> 00:09:38,732
You worked in
a restaurant?

212
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,270
No, I was in India--
it was humid and smelled funny.

213
00:09:43,338 --> 00:09:45,973
All right, I think
I'm getting into a groove here.

214
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,407
This isn't so bad.

215
00:09:47,475 --> 00:09:49,643
Only five hours
and 40 minutes to go.

216
00:09:49,711 --> 00:09:52,279
We've only been
doing this 20 minutes?!

217
00:09:53,014 --> 00:09:54,815
You know, I read that

218
00:09:54,882 --> 00:09:57,517
washing dishes can be an
excellent form of meditation.

219
00:09:57,585 --> 00:09:59,686
The key is that while
washing the dishes

220
00:09:59,754 --> 00:10:04,124
one should only be...
washing the dishes.

221
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,727
Just because you
have that accent

222
00:10:06,794 --> 00:10:09,696
doesn't mean what
you say isn't stupid.

223
00:10:09,764 --> 00:10:11,498
No, seriously.

224
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:13,700
It's about being present
in the moment,

225
00:10:13,768 --> 00:10:16,837
focusing on the feeling
of the warm water,

226
00:10:16,904 --> 00:10:18,705
the smell of
the detergent,

227
00:10:18,773 --> 00:10:22,442
the sound of the dishes squeaking,
and following your own breath.

228
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,912
It's about... it's
about simply being.

229
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,814
Ah.

230
00:10:27,882 --> 00:10:30,183
Okay..I'll try  t.

231
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,124
I need three people
out front.

232
00:10:37,191 --> 00:10:39,793
I'll do it!
Me! Right here!

233
00:10:39,861 --> 00:10:43,330
No fair! I was meditating!

234
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,600
Come on,
don't be mad.

235
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:48,507
It was a long time ago,
and it was an accident.

236
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:51,171
How can reading my journal
be an accident?

237
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:52,305
I didn't even
know what it was.

238
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:54,508
I saw it on your nightstand.
I picked it up.

239
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:56,443
Well, when you realized what
it was, why didn't you stop?

240
00:10:56,511 --> 00:10:58,845
You know me, I'm a
big ol' bookworm.

241
00:11:00,782 --> 00:11:02,222
All right.
Let's just finish cooking.

242
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,185
Well... Hey. O-Okay.
Let me make this up to you.

243
00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:06,887
Sometimes I keep
an online journal.

244
00:11:06,954 --> 00:11:08,622
I want you to read
something that I write.

245
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:10,524
Okay, really, I'm fine.
Okay.

246
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:12,159
Well, then I'll read it to you.

247
00:11:12,226 --> 00:11:14,661
It's from the day we first met.

248
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:19,800
"Beauty, thy name is Penny."
Oh, God.

249
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:21,568
Stop.

250
00:11:21,636 --> 00:11:22,803
I don't want you

251
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,271
to read something
you think'll just butter me up.

252
00:11:24,338 --> 00:11:26,606
I want to hear
the most recent thing you wrote.

253
00:11:26,674 --> 00:11:28,442
Fine.

254
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:29,776
Mmm...

255
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,515
"Penny's beauty,
like our love,

256
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,852
grows more with
each passing day."

257
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,986
Does it really say that?

258
00:11:40,054 --> 00:11:44,124
Why would I lie?

259
00:11:44,192 --> 00:11:47,360
"OMG. OMG.

260
00:11:47,428 --> 00:11:49,296
"We're so close
to the new <i>Star Wars.</i>

261
00:11:49,363 --> 00:11:51,465
"I can't take it.

262
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:53,500
Gah."

263
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:54,568
"Gah"?

264
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:57,270
Well, you didn't
read it right.

265
00:11:57,338 --> 00:12:00,807
The new <i>Star Wars</i>
is coming. Gah!

266
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,015
I'm sensing things
have gotten awkward.

267
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,418
No. It's okay.

268
00:12:11,486 --> 00:12:14,754
If we're friends, we should be
able to talk about anything.

269
00:12:14,822 --> 00:12:16,656
All right.

270
00:12:16,724 --> 00:12:20,760
So, you had some questions
about me seeing other people.

271
00:12:20,828 --> 00:12:22,629
Just a few.

272
00:12:22,697 --> 00:12:24,431
Go ahead.

273
00:12:24,499 --> 00:12:26,433
How many dates have you been on?

274
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:28,435
Who were they with?
Where'd you go?

275
00:12:28,503 --> 00:12:30,904
Where did you meet them?
Did you sleep with them?

276
00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:32,772
And how much longer
to the aquarium?

277
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,175
I'm getting kind of hungry.

278
00:12:35,243 --> 00:12:37,577
Let's see.

279
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:41,448
I have been on six dates
with three different people.

280
00:12:41,516 --> 00:12:44,284
It was either for
coffee or dinner.

281
00:12:44,352 --> 00:12:47,787
One I met at a bookstore
and two I met online.

282
00:12:47,855 --> 00:12:49,589
I haven't slept with anyone.

283
00:12:49,657 --> 00:12:51,324
The aquarium is
40 minutes away.

284
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:53,160
And there's a baggie of Cheerios
for you

285
00:12:53,227 --> 00:12:54,494
in the glove compartment.

286
00:12:54,562 --> 00:12:57,831
Uh, regular or honey nut?

287
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,167
I mixed them.

288
00:13:00,234 --> 00:13:02,435
You mixed them.
No wonder gentleman callers

289
00:13:02,503 --> 00:13:04,604
are pounding down your door.

290
00:13:07,008 --> 00:13:09,276
Do you have any questions
for me?

291
00:13:10,845 --> 00:13:12,779
Just one.

292
00:13:12,847 --> 00:13:15,749
Are you doing okay?

293
00:13:16,784 --> 00:13:19,719
I am.

294
00:13:19,787 --> 00:13:21,354
Good.

295
00:13:21,422 --> 00:13:24,591
I-I want you to be happy.

296
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:26,760
I believe you.

297
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,633
I'd believe you more if you
threw a few Apple Jacks in here.

298
00:13:37,205 --> 00:13:40,240
Here you go.
Thanks.

299
00:13:40,308 --> 00:13:42,075
You got to be kidding me.

300
00:13:42,143 --> 00:13:43,710
Sorry?

301
00:13:43,778 --> 00:13:46,580
Y-You're Elon Musk.

302
00:13:46,647 --> 00:13:47,647
I am.

303
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,255
Wh-What are you doing here?

304
00:13:55,323 --> 00:13:57,490
I'm washing dishes.

305
00:13:57,558 --> 00:13:58,692
Well,

306
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,393
I was on the turkey line,
but I got demoted

307
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:02,829
for being too generous
with the gravy.

308
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:07,033
Oh, man. I...

309
00:14:07,101 --> 00:14:08,568
What an honor to meet you.

310
00:14:08,636 --> 00:14:13,306
I'm-I'm such a fan
of Tesla and SpaceX.

311
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:15,008
All your companies.

312
00:14:15,076 --> 00:14:16,943
Howard Wolowitz, Caltech.

313
00:14:17,011 --> 00:14:19,412
Nice to meet you, Howard.
Feels great to come down here

314
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,114
and help the less fortunate,
huh?

315
00:14:21,182 --> 00:14:23,083
Oh, yeah.

316
00:14:24,118 --> 00:14:28,288
Nothing better
than helping people.

317
00:14:29,223 --> 00:14:32,626
Which is something I realized

318
00:14:32,693 --> 00:14:34,461
when I was viewing Earth

319
00:14:34,528 --> 00:14:37,697
from the deck of
the International Space Station,

320
00:14:37,765 --> 00:14:41,434
where I spent two months as
a payload specialist, a job

321
00:14:41,502 --> 00:14:47,140
I was qualified for because
I'm an MIT-trained engineer.

322
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:50,176
And I thought
I ladled the gravy on thick.

323
00:14:50,244 --> 00:14:52,412
Sorry. It's just...

324
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,780
you're you, you know?

325
00:14:53,848 --> 00:14:57,951
And I really want you
to adopt me.

326
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:59,386
Well, you're here
on Thanksgiving,

327
00:14:59,453 --> 00:15:00,487
so you're probably
a good person.

328
00:15:00,554 --> 00:15:04,190
Oh. I made my wife come down,
too.

329
00:15:04,258 --> 00:15:07,427
You think you might
ever get back out to space?

330
00:15:07,495 --> 00:15:11,331
Is that a job offer? 'Cause
I really want to go to Mars.

331
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,365
Assuming I can
bring my wife.

332
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:13,933
She hardly takes up any room.

333
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:16,836
She's basically a carry-on.

334
00:15:16,904 --> 00:15:18,471
Well, we're not quite there yet,

335
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:20,240
but we're always looking
for engineers.

336
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:22,075
So let me give you my e-mail.
We can stay in touch.

337
00:15:22,143 --> 00:15:23,677
Thank you.

338
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,213
Oh, look.

339
00:15:27,281 --> 00:15:28,815
Someone hardly touched
their pumpkin pie.

340
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:32,218
Want to share it with me?

341
00:15:32,286 --> 00:15:36,222
A-a partially eaten piece
of pumpkin pie

342
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,957
from a homeless shelter?

343
00:15:38,025 --> 00:15:40,093
With Elon Musk, you bet I do!

344
00:15:45,032 --> 00:15:47,734
You know, for a
Thanksgiving buffet

345
00:15:47,802 --> 00:15:51,738
in an aquarium cafeteria,
that was really bad.

346
00:15:51,806 --> 00:15:54,474
You're just upset 'cause
they ran out of Pilgrim hats.

347
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:57,877
They gave one to that baby.
He wasn't even awake.

348
00:15:57,945 --> 00:16:02,716
Well, it wouldn't be a holiday
without you being mad at a baby.

349
00:16:02,783 --> 00:16:04,250
Oh.

350
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:07,954
Would you care to play
an ocean-themed game I invented?

351
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:09,089
Sure. What is it?

352
00:16:09,156 --> 00:16:11,358
It's called Food, Friend, Fight.

353
00:16:11,425 --> 00:16:13,727
One of us chooses
three aquatic creatures,

354
00:16:13,794 --> 00:16:16,262
and the other one must decide
which he would eat,

355
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,998
befriend, or battle.

356
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:21,634
So it's like Kiss, Marry, Kill.

357
00:16:21,702 --> 00:16:22,769
What is that?

358
00:16:22,837 --> 00:16:24,671
It's a game
where you're given three people

359
00:16:24,739 --> 00:16:27,440
and you choose which one
you'd kiss, marry, or kill.

360
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:30,143
Well, my game is better, 'cause
instead of marrying someone,

361
00:16:30,211 --> 00:16:32,879
you get to eat them.

362
00:16:32,947 --> 00:16:34,147
Let's just play.

363
00:16:34,215 --> 00:16:35,749
I'll start
you off easy.

364
00:16:35,816 --> 00:16:40,487
Electric eel,
pufferfish, shrimp.

365
00:16:40,554 --> 00:16:43,156
Hmm. Well,

366
00:16:43,224 --> 00:16:44,691
I wouldn't fight the eel,
because I know

367
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,193
it can generate enough current
to kill a horse.

368
00:16:47,261 --> 00:16:48,828
So I'd eat
the eel,

369
00:16:48,896 --> 00:16:52,031
fight the shrimp,
and befriend the pufferfish,

370
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:53,433
because it would be nice
to have company

371
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:55,568
on those days I feel bloated.

372
00:16:56,604 --> 00:16:58,071
Very well done.

373
00:16:58,139 --> 00:16:59,072
Thank you.

374
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,774
Okay, your turn.

375
00:17:00,841 --> 00:17:03,042
Hmm. Seal,

376
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,178
hagfish...

377
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:08,348
SpongeBob SquarePants.

378
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,184
Well, I'd befriend SpongeBob
but he's not real,

379
00:17:11,252 --> 00:17:12,585
so I can't do that, can I?

380
00:17:12,653 --> 00:17:15,221
But you can pal around
with a hagfish?

381
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:18,224
Hey, let's not pull
at that thread.

382
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:20,126
Okay. I'll
fight SpongeBob,

383
00:17:20,194 --> 00:17:23,930
because he's so friendly we'll
just end up tickling each other.

384
00:17:23,998 --> 00:17:25,732
Um, I'll befriend the seal,

385
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,534
because he's trainable,
which is the problem

386
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:29,202
I'm having with my
current friends.

387
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:33,206
Which means I'll have
to eat the hagfish.

388
00:17:33,274 --> 00:17:35,875
Isn't that gross?
I mean, a hagfish can produce

389
00:17:35,943 --> 00:17:38,445
enough mucus to fill a bucket
in a minute.

390
00:17:38,512 --> 00:17:42,148
I know. It makes its own gravy--
it'll slide right down.

391
00:17:46,754 --> 00:17:50,757
I miss this.

392
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:54,461
How can you miss a game you've
never played before, silly?

393
00:17:56,851 --> 00:17:58,731
I guess sometimes I'm silly.

394
00:18:01,968 --> 00:18:05,237
Hey. Where'd you go? I can't
tell if the turkey's done!

395
00:18:05,304 --> 00:18:07,305
Be right there!

396
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:15,313
Hi, lover.

397
00:18:17,984 --> 00:18:21,553
What are you doing?

398
00:18:21,621 --> 00:18:23,555
I'm sorry about the journal.
I want to make it up to you.

399
00:18:23,623 --> 00:18:29,027
So I'm gonna let you post
a shame photo of me on Facebook.

400
00:18:30,363 --> 00:18:33,031
I am not putting
that on the Internet!

401
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:34,533
I don't want
people to see this.

402
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,235
I don't want to see it!

403
00:18:37,303 --> 00:18:39,704
Don't want people
to see what, huh?

404
00:18:39,772 --> 00:18:42,974
A little bit of this?
Oh...

405
00:18:43,976 --> 00:18:45,277
Huh?

406
00:18:46,612 --> 00:18:48,947
Some of this?

407
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,584
And, since it's Thanksgiving,

408
00:18:52,652 --> 00:18:56,388
an extra helping of this?

409
00:18:56,455 --> 00:18:58,356
Happy Thanks... Yikes.

410
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:11,532
I'm glad you had a
nice time with Amy.

411
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,668
Me, too. It's comforting to know

412
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,270
that she and I are able
to function as friends.

413
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:18,606
Well, I've never been
friends with any of my exes.

414
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:21,509
Oh, I'm sure you and Leonard
will be able to pull it off.

415
00:19:24,313 --> 00:19:27,648
Oh. It's my friend Amy.

416
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:29,216
Hello.

417
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:30,351
Hi, Sheldon.

418
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,852
I'm just driving home
from my mother's.

419
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,788
Did you have a nice time?

420
00:19:33,855 --> 00:19:36,190
I did. Um...

421
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:40,928
listen, I really enjoyed
spending this morning with you.

422
00:19:40,996 --> 00:19:42,930
Well, I can't take
all the credit.

423
00:19:42,998 --> 00:19:44,932
It was pretty funny
when that one anchovy

424
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,935
started going the wrong way.

425
00:19:48,003 --> 00:19:50,404
It was.

426
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:52,940
Uh, listen,

427
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:55,710
I-I was thinking that, um,

428
00:19:55,777 --> 00:20:00,181
maybe I'm ready
to be your girlfriend again.

429
00:20:00,248 --> 00:20:02,683
Oh.

430
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:05,519
I thought we were just friends.

431
00:20:05,587 --> 00:20:06,654
We are.

432
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:09,323
But I was hoping,

433
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:11,292
maybe...
Amy,

434
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,094
I excel at many things,

435
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:16,030
but getting over you
wasn't one of them.

436
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,935
I think I need
to just be your friend.

437
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,271
Okay.

438
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:26,273
I understand.

439
00:20:28,343 --> 00:20:29,810
Good.

440
00:20:29,878 --> 00:20:31,112
Oh, I watched a video

441
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:33,114
of the hagfish producing mucus,

442
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:36,751
so I'm gonna change my answer
and eat SpongeBob.

443
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,020
Okay. Sure.
