        wherever possible. Leaving out the Zion scenes was a major improvement of
        pace and plot development and the most interesting thing about it is that
        these scenes are not missed when left out. We tried to be smart and reduced
        the Matrix sequels to the max. Also we cut out several scenes that just did
        not feel right or felt to be unnecessary, e.G. when Morpheus talks to Link

        pace and plot development and the most interesting thing about it is that
        these scenes are not missed when left out. We tried to be smart and reduced
        the Matrix sequels to the max. Also we cut out several scenes that just did
        not feel right or felt to be unnecessary, e.G. when Morpheus talks to Link

        wherever possible. Leaving out the Zion scenes was a major improvement of
        pace and plot development and the most interesting thing about it is that
        these scenes are not missed when left out. We tried to be smart and reduced
        the Matrix sequels to the max. Also we cut out several scenes that just did
        not feel right or felt to be unnecessary, e.G. when Morpheus talks to Link

        and a certain degree of pre-cognition. But a nasty piece of news hits the
        human resistance: 250,000 machine sentinels are digging to Zion and would
        reach them in 72 hours. As Zion prepares for the ultimate war, Neo, Morpheus
        and Trinity are advised by the Oracle to find the Keymaker who would help
        them reach the Source.  Meanwhile Neo's recurrent dreams depicting Trinity's

        opinion they lost themselves in detail, wanted to much and definetly to show
        off with effect orgies. We tried to continue the Matrix withing the Matrix
        wherever possible. Leaving out the Zion scenes was a major improvement of
        pace and plot development and the most interesting thing about it is that
        these scenes are not missed when left out. We tried to be smart and reduced
        the Matrix sequels to the max. Also we cut out several scenes that just did
        not feel right or felt to be unnecessary, e.G. when Morpheus talks to Link
        about trust, it just feels wrong and Morpheus seems to become a stereotype
