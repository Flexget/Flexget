        opinion they lost themselves in detail, wanted to much and definetly to show
        off with effect orgies. We tried to continue the Matrix withing the Matrix
        wherever possible. Leaving out the Zion scenes was a major improvement of
        pace and plot development and the most interesting thing about it is that
        these scenes are not missed when left out. We tried to be smart and reduced
        the Matrix sequels to the max. Also we cut out several scenes that just did
        not feel right or felt to be unnecessary, e.G. when Morpheus talks to Link
