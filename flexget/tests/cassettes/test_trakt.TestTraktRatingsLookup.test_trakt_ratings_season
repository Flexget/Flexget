        they contend with racism and suspicion in a fledgling republic. Ever since
        the first Jews arrived in America, their efforts to embrace the new culture

        contribute to the growth of the newly founded colony as well as anyone else

        next few centuries, the Jews would play prominent roles in such important
        phases of United States history as the Civil War and westward expansion. From
        politics to entertainment, the Jews would continue to display their unique
        talent for innovation and adaptation in a wide variety of arenas. Yet despite
        the fact that the separation of church and state would open up a wide world
