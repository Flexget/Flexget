        restaurateur Giancarlo Caldesi has decided to take a break from wet and windy
        London for the stunning vistas and sun-drenched vineyards of the land of his
        birth, Tuscany.But with his wedding to organise, a new cookery school in Tuscany

        experience. A good food market needs to be found, the local shops need to
        be visited, the best ingredients sourced and there\u2019s the region\u2019s

        her in amnesia, clouding not only her memories but also her sense of purpose.
        The one thing Luc\xEDa knows for certain is that she must escape from those
        who want to harm her. In the midst of the frenzied race that her life has
        become, she meets Miguel, a handsome young mechanic who, captivated by this
        enigmatic woman\u2019s beauty, decides to help her despite the consequences
        he may face. Love quickly comes into the equation and Miguel becomes her inseparable
        companion in this frantic escape. In time, sporadic flashes from the past
        begin to illuminate Luc\xEDa\u2019s memory, leading her to realize the terrible
        truth: she is the daughter of a vicious arms trafficker and she herself took
        part in his business, as well as in numerous violent murders. She also discovers
        that she is, in fact, a criminal, and that \u201CLuc\xEDa\u201D is only one
        of her many aliases. Going back to that life would force Luc\xEDa to question
        the values she has come to embrace as her own, as well as sacrifice Miguel\u2019s

        to rebel against her past and confront it, with the hope that she still has
        the chance to redeem herself. Luc\xEDa and Miguel will face countless challenges
