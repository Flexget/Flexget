        Happy Video Game Nerd (HVGN). In late-2014 I dropped the HVGN name and established
        Stop Skeletons From Fighting, a new outlet for video reviews (and other future
        projects). Even though I\u2019ve dropped the HVGN name, I still strive to
        set myself apart from the typical review show by using a positive spin to
        highlight lesser-known or underrated games and occasionally entire series.
        Some of the titles I've covered include:-Earthbound-Jumping Flash!-Gargoyle's

        life and doesn't know who she is running from. A mysterious event has left
        her in amnesia, clouding not only her memories but also her sense of purpose.
        The one thing Luc\xEDa knows for certain is that she must escape from those
        who want to harm her. In the midst of the frenzied race that her life has
        become, she meets Miguel, a handsome young mechanic who, captivated by this
        enigmatic woman\u2019s beauty, decides to help her despite the consequences
        he may face. Love quickly comes into the equation and Miguel becomes her inseparable
        companion in this frantic escape. In time, sporadic flashes from the past

        truth: she is the daughter of a vicious arms trafficker and she herself took
        part in his business, as well as in numerous violent murders. She also discovers
        that she is, in fact, a criminal, and that \u201CLuc\xEDa\u201D is only one
