        Stop Skeletons From Fighting, a new outlet for video reviews (and other future

        set myself apart from the typical review show by using a positive spin to
        highlight lesser-known or underrated games and occasionally entire series.

        her in amnesia, clouding not only her memories but also her sense of purpose.
        The one thing Luc\xEDa knows for certain is that she must escape from those
        who want to harm her. In the midst of the frenzied race that her life has
