        Neo has proved to be a good omen for the free humans, as more and more humans
        are being freed from the matrix and brought to Zion, the one and only stronghold
        of the Resistance.  Neo himself has discovered his superpowers including super
        speed, ability to see the codes of the things inside the matrix and a certain
        degree of pre-cognition. But a nasty piece of news hits the human resistance:
        250,000 machine sentinels are digging to Zion and would reach them in 72 hours.
        As Zion prepares for the ultimate war, Neo, Morpheus and Trinity are advised
        by the Oracle to find the Keymaker who would help them reach the Source.  Meanwhile
        Neo''s recurrent dreams depicting Trinity''s death have got him worried and
        as if it was not enough, Agent Smith has somehow escaped deletion, has become
        more powerful than before and has fixed Neo as his next target.","released":"2003-05-15","runtime":138,"trailer":"http://youtube.com/watch?v=zsgrsiZoymA","homepage":"http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/","rating":7.51804,"votes":9395,"updated_at":"2016-09-10T08:55:25.000Z","language":"en","available_translations":["en","de","cs","ru","fr","zh","it","hu","tr","es","pt","sv","fi","nl","pl","sk","he","da","ja","el","bg","th","ko","uk","ro","fa","ca"],"genres":["action","adventure","science-fiction","thriller"],"certification":"R","images":{"fanart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/movies/000/000/482/fanarts/original/4928db3308.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/movies/000/000/482/fanarts/medium/4928db3308.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/movies/000/000/482/fanarts/thumb/4928db3308.jpg"},"poster":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/movies/000/000/482/posters/original/b908a87fb1.jpg","medium":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/movies/000/000/482/posters/medium/b908a87fb1.jpg","thumb":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/movies/000/000/482/posters/thumb/b908a87fb1.jpg"},"logo":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/movies/000/000/482/logos/original/05211ae7b0.png"},"clearart":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/movies/000/000/482/cleararts/original/53d6b06b5b.png"},"banner":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/movies/000/000/482/banners/original/7845b15228.jpg"},"thumb":{"full":"https://walter.trakt.us/images/movies/000/000/482/thumbs/original/0c65446ae0.jpg"}}}'}
