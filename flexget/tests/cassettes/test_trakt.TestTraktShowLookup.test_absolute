        is a TV series based on a Flash animation series published by Vooz Character

        Garu and Pucca help their town of Sooga Village out when evil ninjas attack,
        as well as diffuse a lot of the absurd situations that frequently plague the
        town.  This show could best be described as a cleaned-up version of South
        Park meets Looney Tunes meets Naruto.  There is some very subtly hidden adult
        humor; but most of the adult jokes would not go noticed by small children,
        who are the primary audience.","year":2006,"status":"ended","images":{"poster":{"full":null,"medium":null,"thumb":null},"fanart":{"full":null,"medium":null,"thumb":null}},"ids":{"trakt":6742,"slug":"pucca","tvdb":81774,"imdb":"tt0795256","tmdb":6782,"tvrage":null}}}]'}
