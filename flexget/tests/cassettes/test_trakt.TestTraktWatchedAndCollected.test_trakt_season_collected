        explores the struggle of a tiny minority to integrate itself into the American

        as 17th Century Jews arrive in New Amsterdam, and traces their journey as
        they contend with racism and suspicion in a fledgling republic. Ever since
        the first Jews arrived in America, their efforts to embrace the new culture
        while simultaneously maintaining tradition has often found them frequently
        branded as outsiders. When the first Jews landed on American shores in 1654,
        New Amsterdam governor Peter Stuyvesant attempted to reject them to no avail.
        Overruled by his superiors in the Netherlands - who claimed that Jews could
        contribute to the growth of the newly founded colony as well as anyone else
        - Stuyvesant relented, and a new era was underway. Over the course of the
        next few centuries, the Jews would play prominent roles in such important
        phases of United States history as the Civil War and westward expansion. From
        politics to entertainment, the Jews would continue to display their unique
        talent for innovation and adaptation in a wide variety of arenas. Yet despite
        the fact that the separation of church and state would open up a wide world
        of opportunities for them, the American Jew continued to endure anti-Semitism
        at the behest of such powerful figures as automotive magnate Henry Ford. Through

        Fairs and World Wars; from Alcatraz and Angel Island to fishing fleets, ferry
        boats, freighters and foghorns, San Francisco Bay has been central to the
        identity of one of the world\u2019s leading economic, academic, recreational
        and cultural regions. Widely acclaimed as one of the world\u2019s most beautiful
        natural harbors, San Francisco Bay is the premier estuary on the Pacific Coast
        of both North and South America and is the second most important estuary in
        the United States after Chesapeake Bay. The volume of water per second moving
        out the Golden Gate to the Pacific Ocean is up to seven times that of the
        Mississippi River flowing into the Gulf of Mexico.The Bay is a critical link
        in the Pacific Flyway for millions of migrating birds. It is home to the first
        National Bird Sanctuary (Oakland\u2019s Lake Merritt), the last urban fishery
        (herring) and the largest urban national park in the country (Golden Gate
        National Recreation Area). San Francisco Bay is also the most invaded aquatic
        ecosystem in North America.We meet the people who helped shape the Bay \u2014
        dreamers and schemers, polluters and preservationists, sailors and soldiers,
        tugboat captains and captains of industry. And we catch up with others who
        use the Bay \u2014 as their workplace, playground, commute route or valued
        vista.Saving the Bay is the first television program to tell the story of
        the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary and the people who have shaped and reshaped
        it; from native inhabitants who lived around the Bay for 3,500 years to those
        who now seek to restore balance to a fabled estuary in the midst of one of
        the nation\u2019s largest and most vibrant urban centers.We recount how the
        Bay was almost lost to landfill schemes from the daring to the deranged and
