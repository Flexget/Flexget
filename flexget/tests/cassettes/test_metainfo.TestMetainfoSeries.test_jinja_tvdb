          Westworld was a short-lived 1980 television series that carried on the stories
          of the two feature films, Westworld and Futureworld. It featured Jim McMullan
          as Security Chief John Moore of the Delos Corporation. The story revolved
          around John Moore having to stop the evil scientist, Quaid, as he planned
          to use the robots in Delos to try to take over the world. Despite being
          nominated for two Emmys (Outstanding Achievement In Makeup, and Outstanding
          Art Direction For A Series), only five episodes were produced, and only
          three of them were aired before cancellation.","seriesName":"Beyond Westworld","slug":"beyond-westworld","status":"Ended"},{"aliases":[],"banner":"/banners/posters/5daa4b060618d.jpg","firstAired":"2018-7-18","id":371131,"network":"Tencent
