        is laid up at Skeldale with his foot in plaster. His dreams of mouthwatering
        meals prepared by Mrs. Alton are soon shattered by her regime of a strict

        Mortimer, Mrs. Pumphrey''s great-niece, who has been jilted by her fiance.
        Fortunately, the demanding dog Tricky-Woo provides an ideal excuse for Tristan
        to make a number of house calls. James impresses three hero-worshiping locals
        with his cow-curing abilities, and he learns to value their support when he
        has to judge the Darrowby Vegetable Show, with disastrous results.","images":{"screenshot":{"full":null,"medium":null,"thumb":null}},"ids":{"trakt":395565,"tvdb":279121,"imdb":null,"tmdb":387292,"tvrage":5460}},"show":{"title":"All
