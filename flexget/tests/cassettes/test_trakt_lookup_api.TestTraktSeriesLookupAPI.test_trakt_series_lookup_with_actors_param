        actress. After beginning her career in theatre, Anderson achieved international
        recognition for her role as Special Agent Dana Scully on the American television
        series The X-Files. Her film work includes The House of Mirth (2000), The
        Mighty Celt (2005), The Last King of Scotland (2006), and two X-Files films,
        The X-Files (1998) and The X-Files: I Want to Believe (2008).\\n\\nAnderson
        was born in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Rosemary Anderson (n\xE9e Lane),
        a computer analyst, and Edward Anderson, who owned a film post-production
        company.Her father was of English descent, while her mother was of Irish and
        German ancestry. Soon after her birth, her family moved to Puerto Rico for
        15 months; her family then moved to the United Kingdom where she lived until
        she was 11 years old. She lived for five years in Rosebery Gardens, Crouch
        End, London, and for 15 months in Albany Road, Stroud Green, London, so that
        her father could attend the London Film School.\\n\\nShe was a pupil of Coleridge
        Primary School. When Anderson was 11 years old, her family moved again, this
        time to Grand Rapids, Michigan. She attended Fountain Elementary and then
        City High-Middle School, a program for gifted students with a strong emphasis
        on the humanities; she graduated in 1986.\\n\\nAlong with other actors (notably
        Linda Thorson and John Barrowman) Anderson is bidialectal. With her English

        from a family that immigrated from the Russian Empire and Poland. His mother

        thesis was Magic and Technology in Contemporary Poetry and Prose. At Yale,
        he was a student of popular literary critic Harold Bloom.\\n\\nDuchovny married

        a pescetarian.\\n\\nOn August 28, 2008, Duchovny announced that he had checked
        himself into a rehabilitation facility for treating sex addiction. On October
        15, 2008, Duchovny's and Leoni's representatives issued a statement revealing
        they had separated several months earlier.A week later, Duchovny's lawyer
        said that he planned to sue the Daily Mail over an article it ran that claimed
        he had an affair with Hungarian tennis instructor Edit Pakay while still married
        to Leoni, a claim that Duchovny has denied. On November 15, 2008, the Daily
        Mail retracted their claims. After getting back together, Duchovny and Leoni
        once again split on June 29, 2011.\",\"birthday\":\"1960-08-07\",\"death\":null,\"birthplace\":\"New

        Leigh Anderson (born August 9, 1968, height 5' 3\\\" (1,60 m)) is an American
        actress. After beginning her career in theatre, Anderson achieved international
        recognition for her role as Special Agent Dana Scully on the American television
        series The X-Files. Her film work includes The House of Mirth (2000), The
        Mighty Celt (2005), The Last King of Scotland (2006), and two X-Files films,
        The X-Files (1998) and The X-Files: I Want to Believe (2008).\\n\\nAnderson
        was born in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Rosemary Anderson (n\xE9e Lane),
        a computer analyst, and Edward Anderson, who owned a film post-production
        company.Her father was of English descent, while her mother was of Irish and
        German ancestry. Soon after her birth, her family moved to Puerto Rico for
        15 months; her family then moved to the United Kingdom where she lived until
        she was 11 years old. She lived for five years in Rosebery Gardens, Crouch
        End, London, and for 15 months in Albany Road, Stroud Green, London, so that
        her father could attend the London Film School.\\n\\nShe was a pupil of Coleridge
        Primary School. When Anderson was 11 years old, her family moved again, this
        time to Grand Rapids, Michigan. She attended Fountain Elementary and then
        City High-Middle School, a program for gifted students with a strong emphasis
        on the humanities; she graduated in 1986.\\n\\nAlong with other actors (notably
        Linda Thorson and John Barrowman) Anderson is bidialectal. With her English
        accent and background, Anderson was mocked and felt out of place in the American
        Midwest and soon adopted a Midwest accent. To this day, her accent depends
        on her location \u2014 for instance, in an interview with Jay Leno she spoke
        in an American accent, but shifted it for an interview with Michael Parkinson.\\n\\nAnderson
        was interested in marine biology, but began acting her freshman year in high
        school productions, and later in community theater, and served as a student
        intern at the Grand Rapids Civic Theatre &amp; School of Theatre Arts. She
        attended The Theatre School at DePaul University in Chicago (formerly the
        Goodman School of Drama), where she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1990.
        She also participated in the National Theatre of Great Britain's summer program
        at Cornell University.\\n\\nAnderson's brother died in 2011 of a brain tumor,
        at the age of 30.\\n\\nAnderson married her first husband, Clyde Klotz, The
        X-Files series assistant art director, on New Year's Day, 1994, in Hawaii
        in a Buddhist ceremony. They had a daughter, Piper Maru (born September 1994),
        for whom Chris Carter named the X-Files episode of the same name, and divorced
        in 1997.] In December 2004, Anderson married Julian Ozanne, a documentary
        filmmaker, on Lamu Island, off the coast of Kenya. Anderson announced their
        separation on April 21, 2006.\\n\\nAnderson and former boyfriend, Mark Griffiths,
        have two sons: Oscar, born November 2006 and Felix, born October 2008. She
        ended their relationship in 2012. In March 2012, Anderson told Out magazine
        about her past relationship with a girl while in high school.\\n\\nIn 1997,
        she was chosen by People magazine as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People in
        the World. Askmen listed her at No. 6 on their Top 7: '90s Sex Symbols. In
        2008, she was listed 21st in FHM's All Time 100 Sexiest Hall of Fame.\",\"birthday\":\"1968-08-09\",\"death\":null,\"birthplace\":\"Chicago

        from a family that immigrated from the Russian Empire and Poland. His mother
        is a Lutheran emigrant from Aberdeen, Scotland. His father dropped the h in

        serving in the Army.\\n\\nDuchovny attended Grace Church School and The Collegiate
        School For Boys; both are in Manhattan. He graduated from Princeton University
        in 1982 with a B.A. in English Literature. He was a member of Charter Club,

        of his senior thesis was The Schizophrenic Critique of Pure Reason in Beckett's
        Early Novels. Duchovny played a season of junior varsity basketball as a shooting
        guard and centerfield for the varsity baseball team.\\n\\nHe received a Master
        of Arts in English Literature from Yale University and subsequently began
        work on a Ph.D. that remains unfinished. The title of his uncompleted doctoral
        thesis was Magic and Technology in Contemporary Poetry and Prose. At Yale,
        he was a student of popular literary critic Harold Bloom.\\n\\nDuchovny married
        actress T\xE9a Leoni on May 6, 1997. In April 1999, Leoni gave birth to a
        daughter, Madelaine West Duchovny. Their second child, a son, Kyd Miller Duchovny,
        was born in June 2002. Duchovny is a former vegetarian and, as of 2007, is
        a pescetarian.\\n\\nOn August 28, 2008, Duchovny announced that he had checked
        himself into a rehabilitation facility for treating sex addiction. On October
        15, 2008, Duchovny's and Leoni's representatives issued a statement revealing
        they had separated several months earlier.A week later, Duchovny's lawyer
        said that he planned to sue the Daily Mail over an article it ran that claimed
        he had an affair with Hungarian tennis instructor Edit Pakay while still married
        to Leoni, a claim that Duchovny has denied. On November 15, 2008, the Daily
        Mail retracted their claims. After getting back together, Duchovny and Leoni
        once again split on June 29, 2011.\",\"birthday\":\"1960-08-07\",\"death\":null,\"birthplace\":\"New

        Leigh Anderson (born August 9, 1968, height 5' 3\\\" (1,60 m)) is an American
        actress. After beginning her career in theatre, Anderson achieved international
        recognition for her role as Special Agent Dana Scully on the American television
        series The X-Files. Her film work includes The House of Mirth (2000), The
        Mighty Celt (2005), The Last King of Scotland (2006), and two X-Files films,
        The X-Files (1998) and The X-Files: I Want to Believe (2008).\\n\\nAnderson
        was born in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Rosemary Anderson (n\xE9e Lane),
        a computer analyst, and Edward Anderson, who owned a film post-production
        company.Her father was of English descent, while her mother was of Irish and
        German ancestry. Soon after her birth, her family moved to Puerto Rico for
        15 months; her family then moved to the United Kingdom where she lived until
        she was 11 years old. She lived for five years in Rosebery Gardens, Crouch
        End, London, and for 15 months in Albany Road, Stroud Green, London, so that
        her father could attend the London Film School.\\n\\nShe was a pupil of Coleridge
        Primary School. When Anderson was 11 years old, her family moved again, this
        time to Grand Rapids, Michigan. She attended Fountain Elementary and then

        on the humanities; she graduated in 1986.\\n\\nAlong with other actors (notably
        Linda Thorson and John Barrowman) Anderson is bidialectal. With her English
        accent and background, Anderson was mocked and felt out of place in the American
        Midwest and soon adopted a Midwest accent. To this day, her accent depends
        on her location \u2014 for instance, in an interview with Jay Leno she spoke
        in an American accent, but shifted it for an interview with Michael Parkinson.\\n\\nAnderson
        was interested in marine biology, but began acting her freshman year in high
        school productions, and later in community theater, and served as a student
        intern at the Grand Rapids Civic Theatre &amp; School of Theatre Arts. She
        attended The Theatre School at DePaul University in Chicago (formerly the
        Goodman School of Drama), where she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1990.
        She also participated in the National Theatre of Great Britain's summer program
        at Cornell University.\\n\\nAnderson's brother died in 2011 of a brain tumor,
        at the age of 30.\\n\\nAnderson married her first husband, Clyde Klotz, The
        X-Files series assistant art director, on New Year's Day, 1994, in Hawaii
        in a Buddhist ceremony. They had a daughter, Piper Maru (born September 1994),
        for whom Chris Carter named the X-Files episode of the same name, and divorced
        in 1997.] In December 2004, Anderson married Julian Ozanne, a documentary
        filmmaker, on Lamu Island, off the coast of Kenya. Anderson announced their
        separation on April 21, 2006.\\n\\nAnderson and former boyfriend, Mark Griffiths,
        have two sons: Oscar, born November 2006 and Felix, born October 2008. She
        ended their relationship in 2012. In March 2012, Anderson told Out magazine
        about her past relationship with a girl while in high school.\\n\\nIn 1997,
        she was chosen by People magazine as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People in
        the World. Askmen listed her at No. 6 on their Top 7: '90s Sex Symbols. In
