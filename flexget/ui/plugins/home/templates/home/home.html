    <h1>FlexGet WEB-UI</h1>

    <p>
    Hi there, this is early user interface prototype!
    </p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="background: #FD9752; padding: 1em; font-size:16pt;">
            <p>
                The interface is not yet ready for end users. Consider this preview only state.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you still use it anyways, please do report back to us how well it works, does it
                leak memory etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                We also do really require more man-power to develop webui further. Please join the effort!
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
